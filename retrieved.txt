Provided that an unregistered document affecting immovable 
property and required by this Act or the Transfer of Property Act, 
1882, to be registered may be received as evidence of a contract in 
a suit for specific performance under Chapter II of the Specific Relief 
Act, 1877 or as evidence of any collateral transaction not required 
to be effected by registered instrument.”  

10. In Kaladevi (supra), this Court has held that an unregistered 
document may be received as evidence of a contract in a suit 
seeking specific performance. The relevant portion from the 
decision is as follows:

6. The appellant filed a Civil Revision Petition before the High 
Court and by the order impugned before us the High Court held 
that the document was unstamped and unregistered and cannot 
be brought on record.  

7. Though notice was issued on 30.07.2021 and the case was 
adjourned from time to time, the respondents have not entered 
appearance. By order dated 22.03.2022 this Court recorded that 
service upon respondent no. 4 is deemed to have been completed 
in terms of order dated 29.11.2021.  However, the case was further 
adjourned from time to time for almost two years and we have now 
decided to dispose of this appeal.  

8. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the courts 
below have disregarded the proviso to Section 49 of the 
Registration Act which allows tendering of documents that 
endorses an oral agreement of sale. In support of his contention, 
he relied on the decision of this Court in S. Kaladevi v. V.R. 
Somasundaram4. He also submitted that reliance on Section 
17(1A) of the Registration Act was not correct in as much as the 
document was executed on 01.01.2000.

9. Having considered the matter in detail, we are of the opinion 
that the prayer of the appellant in the interlocutory application 
falls under proviso to Section 49 of the Registration Act which 
provides that an unregistered document affecting immovable 
property may be received as evidence of a contract in a suit for 
specific performance. The proviso also enables the said document 
to be received in evidence of a collateral transaction. Section 49 
reads as follows: 

“49. Effect of non-registration of documents required to be 
registered.—No document required by section 17 [or by any 
provision of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, to be registered 
shall—  
(a) affect any immovable property comprised therein, or  
(b) confer any power to adopt, or  
(c) be received as evidence of any transaction affecting such 
property or conferring such power, unless it has been registered:

3. Short facts leading to the filing of this appeal are as follows. 
It is the case of the appellant that on the basis of an agreement of 
sale dated 01.01.2000, the respondent agreed to sell his property 
upon receiving part consideration of Rs. 5000/- and also put the 
appellant in possession of the property. Subsequently, i.e. on 
01.09.2002, it is alleged by the appellant that the parties have 
agreed that the property should be sold at the rate of Rs. 550 per 
cent and in furtherance of the said transaction the appellant also 
paid a sum of Rs. 10,000/- and is said to have paid balance 
consideration from time to time. However, as the respondent was 
not taking any steps for executing the sale deed, he was compelled 
to institute a suit1 for specific performance of the agreement and 
also for a permanent injunction.

### bae0adb8-dfc8-48e8-abcb-0e812dc368d4:7 [chroma]
collateral transaction not required to be effected by registered 
document. When an unregistered sale deed is tendered in 
evidence, not as evidence of a completed sale, but as proof of 
an oral agreement of sale, the deed can be received in evidence 
making an endorsement that it is received only as evidence of 
an oral agreement of sale under the proviso to Section 49 of 
1908 Act.”

1. Leave granted. 

2. This appeal is against the order passed by the High Court of 
Judicature at Madras in CRP.PD. No. 2828 of 2015 dated 
26.02.2021, whereby the High Court dismissed the Civil Revision 
Petition filed against the order passed by the Trial Court on 
21.04.2015 dismissing the interlocutory application filed by the 
appellant seeking permission to place on record a document dated 
01.01.2000.

“12. The main provision in Section 49 provides that any 
document which is required to be registered, if not registered, 
shall not affect any immovable property comprised therein nor 
such document shall be received as evidence of any 
transaction affecting such property. The proviso, however, 
would show that an unregistered document affecting 
immovable property and required by the 1908 Act or 
the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 to be registered may be 
received as an evidence to the contract in a suit for specific 
performance or as evidence of any collateral transaction not 
required to be effected by registered instrument. By virtue of 
the proviso, therefore, an unregistered sale deed of an 
immovable property of the value of Rs 100 and more could be 
admitted in evidence as evidence of a contract in a suit for 
specific performance of the contract. Such an unregistered sale 
deed can also be admitted in evidence as an evidence of any 
collateral transaction not required to be effected by registered 
document. When an unregistered sale deed is tendered in 
evidence, not as evidence of a completed sale, but as proof of

4. Pending disposal of the suit, the appellant filed an 
interlocutory application2 under Order 7, Rule 14 (3) read with 
Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 19083, for bringing on 
record and marking the document dated 01.01.2000. In the said 
application, the appellant averred that for genuine reasons he was 
unable to produce the said document, which got mixed up with 
other documents. He averred that a photocopy of the said 
document was anyway enclosed with the plaint and therefore the 
respondent/defendant will not in any way be prejudiced if the 
prayer in the interlocutory application is allowed and the original 
of the said document is received and marked. 

5. Learned Trial Court by order dated 21.04.2015 dismissed the 
said application holding that the reasons for not producing the 
original is not convincing and also that the said document was 
unstamped and unregistered and as such barred under Section 35 
of the Indian Stamp Act, 1989, and that Section 17 of the 
Registration Act, 1908.

### bae0adb8-dfc8-48e8-abcb-0e812dc368d4:8 [chroma]
11. It is also evident from the plaint that the document dated 
01.01.2000 is referred to and in fact a photocopy of the said 
document is filed along with the plaint. It is the case of the 
appellant that the document sought to be brought on record is 
intended only to be used as a proof of the oral agreement of sale 
and that it is permitted under Section 49 of the Registration Act. 
Under these facts and circumstances, we are of the opinion that 
the appellant can be permitted to introduce the said document 
dated 01.01.2000. We make it clear that we have not expressed any 
opinion on the contents of the document and it is also open for the 
respondent/defendant to raise and contest the relevancy and 
validity of the document as are permissible in law and it is for the 
Trial Court to consider the submissions and pass appropriate 
judgment/order as it considers appropriate. 

12. In view of the above, we allow the appeal and set aside the 
judgment and order passed by the High Court in CRP.PD. No. 2828 
of 2015 and direct that the I.A. No. 1397 of 2014 in OS No. 78 of 
2012 for marking document dated 01.01.2000 is allowed. 

13. No order as to costs.
